This project represents my first real attempt at utilizing CUDA. I've chosen to apply it in a simulation of Navier-Stokes equations, which are fundamental in fluid dynamics. 

The goal was to leverage CUDAâ€™s powerful GPU acceleration to enhance the computation speed and efficiency of these complex simulations.

As this project marks my initial foray into using CUDA, there may be some inaccuracies in the code. My approach was exploratory, focusing on learning and applying CUDA to complex fluid dynamics simulations. 

I welcome feedback and suggestions for improvement as I continue to refine my skills and understanding of this powerful technology.
